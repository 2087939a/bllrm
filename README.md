Personal project done on my spare time. Currently in development. 

-You can check D3.js code samples in the templates/index.html file. 

-Populate scripts is mainly used with pandas, json and csv libraries, as well as Youtube Data API.
I create and write all the json and csv files in those population scripts.

More to come ! Like inserting weights of view counts to each nodes corresponding ot each artist and edit of most csv files as there are a few 'undefined' locations that I was unable to get from Youtube.

Have fun
